Hello everybody, everybody hello. Not much to say I'm just testing
this thing up.

Obviously the site description tells you more than enough on the content
of this blog and I hope it'll help some people resolve problems
I spent countless hours to fix because even Stackoverflow was of no help.

Sometimes you just gotta try hard the damn thing until it works.

BTW this site has no JS because YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT THIS EVERY FUCKING WHEREFOSdjfdsfsfdj

No tracking, no ads, no fucks and what nots.

If I make up my mind the content will be published in both French and English. Or I'll Deepl 
them because I'm too lazy to translate. 

ye I've let the original Jekyll post up because I like it, what you gonna do about it ?

xoxo
